Observations:

There seems to be a correlation between the number of drivers and the average fare price. In the Urban cities, there are more drivers on the road thereby bringing the cost of fares down significantly compared to areas where there are less number of drivers on the road.

In Rural and Suburban cities, there are less drivers available on the road leading to a higher cost in fares. A limited supply suggests less competition and higher fares. 

There also seems to be a correlation between the number of rides given to the average fare price. In Rural cities, there are far less ride counts leading to higher fares as discussed above. However, the reason could also be because the distance traveled is much longer leading to higher fares.
